RoboRunner is a multi-threaded / multi-process Robocode battle runner.

Installation overview:
  * Unzip to a new directory, eg ~/roborunner
  * Run setup.sh to clone an existing Robocode install. (Each thread
    uses its own install.)
  * Copy some bots into bots/ subdirectory.
  * Configure a challenge in a .rrc file.
  * Run some battles with rr.sh.

See the output of rr.sh for help, or visit http://robowiki.net?RoboRunner
for more detailed information.

RoboRunner depends on Guava, Google's core libraries for Java, which you
can grab here: http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/
If you downloaded a RoboRunner binary installation, there's a Guava
JAR already in the lib directory.

You'll also need Robocode, of course: http://robocode.sourceforge.net/

Happy Robocoding!
